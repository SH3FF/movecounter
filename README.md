# Move Countdown Webpage

This repository contains a simple responsive webpage that displays a countdown to August 1, 2025, the date of the move to Chicago. The page shows the remaining time in weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds, along with how many weekends are left before the move. A toggle button switches between light and dark themes.

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the timer.
